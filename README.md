Covid19Tracker

Covid19Traker updates the Covid Cases in search by country name 
This website is used to track the real time changes in the cases of pandemic covid19.
I have built a real-time Covid Cases Updating dashboard which displays the cases based on country selected.
Covid19 Tracker gives the update about recovered,confirmed and deaths for the selected country.
This website is created using Covid19 API data source https://covid19api.com/ this will fetch the realâ€“time data for the Covid cases.
